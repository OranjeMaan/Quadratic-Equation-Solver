# Quadratic-Equation-Solver
Created by Oranje Maan in September 2018
The code shall display the roots of the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c given the values of a, b, and c. 
If a = 0, and therefore making the equation not quadratic, the code shall stop.
If the quadratic equation does not have a real solution, then the imaginery shall be displayed. 
This was programmed in 2.7 but should work with the current version of python.
